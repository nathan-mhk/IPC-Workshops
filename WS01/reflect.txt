1. I do have previous programming experiences, but they were from a couple
   years ago already. C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, VBA. My 
   experiences with C, C++, and Java were all during my uni period. I do
   have a little bit more workplace-level experiences with JavaScript,
   Python, and VBA.

2. Compiler is like a translater that converts a program written in higher
   level languages (like C) into machine level language. GCC is a compiler
   collection, in which C is one of the languages that it supports. There
   are lots of options that one can use when compiling your files, like
   optimization level, name of the compiled files, etc.

3. I haven't touched programming related things for almost 2 years now,
   so I would treat myself as having a fresh start, and a refresh on some
   fundamentals with this course. However, because I do have some
   background, I have high goals and expectations on myself. And I hope
   my skills haven't got too rusty to achieve that.
