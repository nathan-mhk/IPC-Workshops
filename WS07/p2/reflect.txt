    Yes. The game had prompted users for the specific path length of the 
    game during the set-up phase, and player's position during the playing 
    phase. We can use these stored variables as the terminating condition 
    in for loops to enclose repetitive codes.

2.
    By using structures, we can group related variables together under the 
    same construct. Like player's lives and player's treasures. It will be 
    easier for us to understand and read the code as we can easily 
    identify whether the variable is associated with the player or the 
    game. Without using structure, the code will not be easily scalable. 
    For instance, if we want to add a second player to the game, with 
    structure, all we need to do is simply declare an extra variable of 
    the same structure. Without structure, we will need to add a lot of 
    variables which is essentially the same as the first player. Which 
    will make the program a lot more complicated and messy.

3.
    My code ended up with a maximum of 3 levels of nesting:
    do {
      if (repeat) {
        if (player.moves[playerPos - 1]) {} else {
          if (game.bombs[playerPos - 1] && game.treas[playerPos - 1]) {
          }
        }
      }
    } while (repeat);
